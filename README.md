# Omnifood-Website
This repository contains the files for the website that I created while taking Jonas Schmedtmann's ["Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923) Course on Udemy.

The website introduces a imaginary meal-plan company called 'Omnifood' and appeals to the audience by its fluid layouts using CSS Flexbox & Grid, responsive units, flexible images, and media queries.
